Problem:
  Cannot migrate properly the tables using php artisan migrate because of the foreign key constraints,
  which means, there should be a parent table that should be created first before creating a table that
  needs it.

Solution:
  Create a migration tables that doesn't need a foreign key (parent table) before creating a migration that
  has a foreign keys.
